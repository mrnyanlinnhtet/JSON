XML = eXtensible Markup Language

eXtensible = exten your notating

XML is not all the same HTML. But both are Markup Language.
XML is used to describe data. HTML is used to display the data.
XML must define custom rules (tags). HTML has pre-define rules (tags).

XML Document = Describe data (XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.)
HTML Document = Display data (HTML was designed to display data and focus on how data look.)

eg.

Product List                              Root Element (Parent Element)
      Product                             Child of root element (Child Element)
          Name                            Root Node
          Price                           Root Node
          Description                     Root Node


All XML document must start with XML Declaration.
<? xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
